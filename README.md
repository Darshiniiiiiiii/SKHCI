## Project Title: Work Management Dashboard

### Overview
The Work Management Dashboard was developed as a comprehensive tool designed to help users manage their workload effectively. It provided visual insights into pending tasks, performance metrics, completed work, notifications, and project analytics. The dashboard was built with a focus on user experience, accessibility, and real-time data visualization.

### Features
- **Pending Work Tracker:** Displayed the number of pending tasks categorized by priority (High, Medium, Low) using bar or pie charts.
- **Performance Improvement Analysis:** Tracked individual performance over time with line charts, including metrics like task completion rate and feedback scores.
- **Completed Work Overview:** Visualized completed tasks using stacked bar charts, categorized by project or task type (e.g., Bugs Fixed, Features Developed).
- **Notifications Dashboard:** Categorized notifications (Mentions, Meeting Reminders, Deadlines, Project Updates) using donut charts or timeline charts.
- **Workload Distribution Analysis:** Implemented a heatmap to visualize workload distribution across teams and time periods, helping identify overworked employees.
- **Project Success and Failure Analytics:** Used comparative bar charts to show success and failure rates of different projects, providing insights for improvement.
- **User  Accessibility and Inclusivity Considerations:** Included features such as dark mode, font adjustments, screen reader support, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Eye-Gazing Model Integration:** Integrated an eye-gazing model to track user availability and detect engagement levels during virtual meetings, improving transparency and accountability.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js, D3.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket
- **Accessibility:** ARIA standards, WCAG compliance
- **Machine Learning:** Eye-gazing detection algorithms (if applicable)

. **Access the Dashboard:**
   Opened a web browser and navigated to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration).
